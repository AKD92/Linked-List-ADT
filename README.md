# Linked-List-in-C
Two linked list implementation in C language. One is Singly linked (next only) and the other is Doubly linked (next & prev). These linked lists also care about "User Objects" stored on them, and whether those user object should be destroyed (de-allocated from memory if they were dynamically allocated) when the list itself is destroyed via a "destroy (void *data)" function pointer.
